Children, ye have not lived, to you it seems 

Life is a lovely stalactite of dreams, 

Or carnival of careless joys that leap 

About your hearts like billows on the deep 

In flames of amber and of amethyst. 

孩子啊，你不算真正地活过，对你来说，

人生是那梦幻的钟乳石

抑或是那无忧无虑的狂欢

你的心啊，如深渊中的巨浪

在琥珀和紫水晶般的烈焰中翻腾

Children, ye have not lived, ye but exist 

Till some resistless hour shall rise and move

Your hearts to wake and hunger after love,

And thirst with passionate longing for the things 

That burn your brows with blood-red sufferings. 

孩子啊，你不算真正地活过，仅仅只是活着

直到某些无法抗拒的时刻来临

你的心啊，才渐渐苏醒，急切地渴望爱情

渴望世间美好之物

可是它们剪不断理还乱

Till ye have battled with great grief and fears, 

And borne the conflict of dream-shattering years, 

Wounded with fierce desire and worn with strife, 

Children, ye have not lived: for this is life.

除非你战胜过悲伤恐惧

承受过让你梦想破灭的年岁

因剧烈的欲望而受伤、因冲突倾轧而疲惫不堪

孩子啊，你不算真正地活过：这就是人生
