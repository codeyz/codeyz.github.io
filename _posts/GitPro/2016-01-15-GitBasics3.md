###Tagging
Tag is a mark to specific points in history. Typically, pepole use it to mark release poings(v1.0, and so on).

####Listing your tags

	$ git tag
	v0.1.0
	v0.2.0
	v0.2.1
	
This command lists all your tags. We can pass `-l` option to list tags with particular pattern.

	$ git tag -l "v0.1*"
	v0.1.0
	
Using following command to view tag information.

	git show <tag-name>

	
####Creating tags
Git has two types of tags: **lightweight** and **annotated**. A lightweight tag is just a pointer to a specific commit, while an annotated tag is stored as full objects in the Git database, with tagger name, email, date and so on. 

#####Creating lightweight tags

	git tag <tag-name>
	
####Creating annotated tags

	git tag -a <tag-name> [-m <tag-message>]
	
	###tag specific commits
	git tag -a <tag-name> <commits-checksum>
	
####Sharing tags

By default, `git push` doesn't transfer tags to remote servers, you have to use this command to push a specific tag:

	git push origin <tag-name>
	
If there are several tags you want to transfer at one time:

	git push origin --tags
