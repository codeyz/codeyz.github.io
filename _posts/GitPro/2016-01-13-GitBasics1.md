###Getting a Git Repository
####`git init`
This command will create a new subdirectory `.git` in current directory. Then, you can track files using:

	git add *
	git commit -m "Add Project: Test"
	
####`git clone [url]`
This command clones repository from remote server.

####Basic states and transformation of files

git command         | transformation   |
--------------------|------------------|
`git add`           |    Add *untracked* or *modified* files to staging area|
`git commit`       | Commit files in staging area to repository  |
`git checkout`  | Checkout a file from repository      |
`git reset`      | Unstage files|
`git status`| Check status of files|
`git rm`|Remove files|

###Ignoring files
If there are files you don't want to track, you can add ignoring patterns to file `.gitignore`. The fules for the patterns are:

1. Blank lines or lines starting with # are ignored
2. Standard glob patterns work.
3. Use patterns begin with `/` to avoid recuisivity.
4. Use patterns end with `/`to specify a directory.
5. Use patterns begin with `!` to negate a pattern.

###Vewing changes of files: `git diff`

1. `git diff [files]`: vewing changes between staged and unstaged.
2. `git diff --staged [files]`: vewing changes between staged and committed.
3. `git diff --cached [files]`: `--staged` and `--cached` are synonyms.

###Removing files
To remove a file, using `git rm` command. It will remove the file from the staging area and after next time you commit, it will be gone, also deleted in your disk. If you want to untrack the file but still be preserved in your disk, pass `--cached` to this command.

###Moving files
To moving files, using `git mv`.

###Vewing the commit history
Command `git log` lists the commit history. Here are several popular options.

options         | description   |
--------------------|------------------|
`-<n>`    | list the latest n commits|
`-p` | show the patch of every commit|
`--graph` | display the graph of branch and merge history|
`--pretty` | show commits in an customized format|

###Undoing things

####Recommit
After commit, you may find that some files are forgotten, command `git commit --amend` can replace the previous commit with a new one.

	git commit -m "Version1"
	git add ignored_file
	git commit --amend -m "Version1"
	

####Unstaging a staged file
If you want to unstage files on the staged area, use command below:

	git reset HEAD <file>
	
This command will unstage the file back to your work directory. `git reset` is very dangerous if you call it with `--hard`, it will reset index and working tree. That is, **every file** you modified or staged will be reverted to states of last commit. Don't use this option unless you definetely discard your modification.

####Unmodifying a modified file
If you want to discard your changes of files, following command works:

	git checkout -- <file>
	
This command is also dangerous because it reverts the file back to last commit. Every changes you have added will be gone.
